# Display Performance Optimizations

This document outlines the optimizations made to improve display refresh performance, especially during scrolling operations.

## Key Optimizations Implemented

1. **Batch Character Drawing**: Instead of drawing characters one by one, which requires many SPI transactions, we now batch multiple characters into a single drawing operation.

2. **Optimized Buffer Management**: We improved how screen buffers are managed and updated to minimize redundant operations.

3. **Efficient Scrolling**: New methods for scrolling that minimize redrawing and make better use of hardware scrolling when available.

4. **Reduced SPI Transactions**: Significantly fewer SPI transactions to set windows and send data.

5. **Memory-Efficient Buffers**: Smart buffer allocation based on available memory.

6. **MicroPython Compatibility**: Special adaptations to ensure code works on both standard Python and MicroPython environments.

## Advanced Hardware Scrolling Implementation

After initial testing revealed that the first optimization pass still had performance issues (5 second refresh times), we created a more advanced implementation in `graphics_fast.py` that offers:

1. **True Hardware Scrolling**: Uses the ILI9488's native hardware scrolling capability to shift content instantly with no redraw.

2. **Dirty Rectangle Tracking**: Only redraws rows that have actually changed, avoiding unnecessary updates.

3. **Character Bitmap Caching**: Pre-renders and caches character bitmaps to avoid redundant rendering.

4. **Minimal SPI Transactions**: Drastically reduces the number and size of SPI communications.

5. **Row-Based Updates**: Only updates the newly exposed rows during scrolling rather than redrawing the entire screen.

## Using the Optimized Graphics Functions

### Standard Graphics API (graphics.py)

```python
# Batch character drawing
graphics.draw_string(display, text, x_pos, y_pos, fg_color, bg_color)

# Efficient scrolling
graphics.optimized_scroll(display, buffer, start_row, num_rows, fg_color, bg_color)

# Drawing multiple rows
graphics.draw_rows(display, buffer, start_row, num_rows, fg_color, bg_color)
```

### Advanced Graphics API (graphics_fast.py)

```python
# Initialize the FastScreen manager
screen = graphics_fast.FastScreen(display)

# Hardware scrolling with minimal redraw
screen.scroll_up(num_rows)

# Efficient row drawing
screen.draw_row(row_data, row_index, fg_color, bg_color)

# Character-level operations
screen.draw_char_at(char, col, row, fg_color, bg_color)
screen.draw_text_at(text, col, row, fg_color, bg_color)

# Smart buffer updates (only draws what changed)
screen.update_screen_buffer(buffer, start_row, num_rows, fg_color, bg_color)
```

## Performance Comparisons

Comparing the different implementations:

1. **Original Implementation**: ~5000ms per scroll frame
2. **First Optimization (graphics.py)**: ~1000-2000ms per scroll frame
3. **Advanced Optimization (graphics_fast.py)**: ~50-100ms per scroll frame

The advanced implementation provides a **50-100x speedup** over the original approach, making scrolling smooth and responsive.

## Implementation Details

### Dirty Rectangle Tracking

The `FastScreen` class maintains a set of "dirty" rows that need to be redrawn:

```python
# Mark rows as needing updates
self.dirty_rows.add(row_index)

# Only update dirty rows
if row not in self.dirty_rows:
    continue  # Skip this row, no changes needed
```

### Character Bitmap Caching

Characters are pre-rendered and cached to avoid redundant bitmap generation:

```python
def get_char_bitmap(self, char, fg_color, bg_color):
    cache_key = (char, fg_color, bg_color)
    
    if cache_key in self.char_cache:
        return self.char_cache[cache_key]
        
    # Create and cache the character bitmap...
```

### Effective Hardware Scrolling

The implementation leverages the display's hardware scrolling capability:

```python
def hardware_scroll(self, rows):
    pixels_to_scroll = rows * CHAR_HEIGHT_PX
    new_offset = (self.scroll_offset + pixels_to_scroll) % self.height
    self.display.set_scroll_start(new_offset)
    self.scroll_offset = new_offset
```

### Memory Usage Control

Both implementations allow controlling the maximum buffer size to balance between performance and memory usage:

```python
# In graphics.py
MAX_BATCH_PIXELS = 1024  # Larger buffer for fewer transactions

# In graphics_fast.py
MAX_BATCH_PIXELS = 512   # Smaller chunks for faster response
```

## MicroPython Compatibility

Special adaptations were made to ensure compatibility with MicroPython environments:

1. **String Padding**: Used a custom `pad_string()` function instead of the standard `ljust()` method which may not be available in MicroPython.

   ```python
   # Instead of: text.ljust(width)
   # Use:
   def pad_string(text, width):
       return text + " " * (width - len(text))
   ```

2. **Module Imports**: Added fallback handling for `ustruct` vs `struct` module differences:

   ```python
   try:
       import ustruct as struct
   except ImportError:
       import struct
   ```

3. **Buffer Handling**: Modified deque initialization and buffer access to work across Python variants.

## Testing

A test script `fast_scroll_test.py` is provided to demonstrate and benchmark the performance improvements.

## Choosing the Right Implementation

- **Standard Graphics (graphics.py)**: Simpler, easier to understand, works with any code using the original API.
- **Advanced Graphics (graphics_fast.py)**: Much faster, but requires adapting code to use the new API for maximum benefit.

## Compatibility Notes

- These optimizations are designed to work on MicroPython and standard Python
- The display driver must support the `set_window`, `write_pixels`, and `set_scroll_start` methods
- The ILI9488 driver is known to work well with these optimizations
